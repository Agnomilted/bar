I'm trying to make an archive format like tar.

TODO:
- Produce a complete archive file.
    - Figure out what to store in the header part of file entries 
- Extract an automatically produced archive file.
- Make a better readme.
- After achieving the previous goals, rewrite the code in Rust and have equivalent sources in both languages.

idk what im doing i couldnt even understand what tar has in its files
